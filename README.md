This my first data project, I did it for my Data Scientist training. At the beginning the objective was to use all the classification models and to obtain a good score. I thought that I need to do some simple prreprocessing, and the fancy models would give me a magic score. In reality, the calculation ran endlessly, after a long wait, the score didn't change...

I started thinking about data cleaning and features selection seriously.

   Maybe in some cases, we don't need to do it?
